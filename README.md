# NFT Creator

This is a random content creator.
The script will return a screen containing 10 rows and 10 collumns, having a random distribution of colors.



## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install turtle.

```bash
pip install turtle
```


## Usage

The script is made to show the user the creation process too, but that can be rushed as the speed variable can be modified.
It has a color recognition part commented out at the beginning, that can be used if the user desires to use a special kind of color pallete.

```python
# import colorgram
#
# rgb_colors = []
# colors = colorgram.extract("image.jpg", 30)
#
# for color in colors:
#     r = color.rgb.r
#     g = color.rgb.g
#     b = color.rgb.b
#     new_color = (r, g, b)
#     rgb_colors.append(new_color)
#
# print(rgb_colors)
```

## Future Development

Work out the export for every OS, as it's dependable on the screen-capture ability and it's different from one OS to another.
